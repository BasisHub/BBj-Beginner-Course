# Introduction - PLEASE READ FIRST!

## Structure of this Material

This course is in wide parts a Meta-Material that intends to "set you on the right track". Instead of repeating information that is in the documentation, it tries to explain concepts, sometimes with some videos, sometimes with text, but very often by linking into existing product documentation. That way, you will learn from this course "how to fish", it will not just show you "one particular fish".

## Who can use this course

This training material is a work in progress (September 2021) and is intended to introduce software developers into the professional development with BBj, which they might need for their new position.

This training assumes that its consumers know already how to write software in some other programming language. The material **does not** explain:

- what a computer program is.
- what loops and IF-conditions are.
- Object Orientation.
- How to use an IDE or a Code Editor.

You will need to have learned about all these things as part of your prior education or work experience. Check with your manager or mentor if you feel you need to close some gaps in these areas, to receive recommendations for books or online courses.
